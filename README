Welcome to YANAS, yet another air traffic control simulator.

The goal behind this project is to create a realistic simulator that
follows standard ATC procedures. As such, it is planned to support
SIDs and STARs as specified in the AIP, that the various aircraft will
be able to follow automatically without controller intervention, and
when necessary, accepting a direct, an amended or an alternative
clearance. Why? Because it's fun.

This project is in a very early stage right now, I'm mainly putting it
up on github at this point to have a backup of the files. :-}
